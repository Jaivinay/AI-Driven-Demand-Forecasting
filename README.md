# 🧠 AI-Driven Demand Forecasting & Dynamic Pricing  
**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), Reinforcement Learning (PPO)

## 📌 Overview  
This project uses the Walmart M5 dataset to forecast sales across multiple stores and SKUs using the **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**.  
A Reinforcement Learning model (PPO) is implemented to recommend **optimal product prices** to maximize revenue and reduce stock-outs.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- Multi-time-series forecasting using **TFT**  
- **Dynamic pricing** with RL (PPO)  
- Improves pricing efficiency by ~25%  
- End-to-end scalable pipeline for retail analytics  
- Clear notebook with steps, visuals, and results
